## üéØ What You Need to Do (3 Steps)

### STEP 1: Get Supabase Service Role Key (1 minute)

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/oohttpknzjchpdfogled/settings/api
2. Scroll to "Project API keys" section
3. Find the **service_role** key (it says "secret" next to it)
4. Click "Reveal" or the copy icon
5. **PASTE IT HERE** ‚Üí I'll add it to GitHub secrets for you

**What it looks like:**
```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Im9vaHR0cGtuempjaHBkZm9nbGVkIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTcyOTY0MDE1MywiZXhwIjoyMDQ1MjE2MTUzfQ.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

---

### STEP 2: Run 3 Quick Commands (2 minutes)

After you paste the service role key, I'll run these commands:

```bash
# Add sensitive secrets to GitHub
gh secret set SUPABASE_ANON_KEY --body "[your-anon-key]"
gh secret set SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY --body "[your-service-key]"
gh secret set CLARITY_API_KEY --body "[your-clarity-key]"
gh secret set SENDGRID_API_KEY --body "[your-sendgrid-key]"

# Install new dependencies
npm install

# Verify everything works
npm run build
```

---

### STEP 3: Verify SendGrid Sender (2 minutes)

**CRITICAL for email to work:**

1. Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth/senders
2. Click "Create New Sender"
3. Fill in:
   ```
   From Name: TGI Agency
   From Email: noreply@tgiagency.com
   Reply To: quotes@tgiagency.com
   Company Address: [your address]
   ```
4. Click "Create"
5. **Check your email** (noreply@tgiagency.com inbox)
6. Click verification link in email from SendGrid

**Why this matters:** SendGrid won't send emails from unverified addresses.

## üöÄ After Everything Works Locally

### Deploy to Production:

```bash
# Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: production setup with Supabase, Clarity, and SendGrid"

# Push to GitHub (triggers CI/CD)
git push origin main

# Monitor workflow
gh run watch

# Or view in browser:
# https://github.com/shmindmaster/tgiagency/actions
```

### If GitHub Actions Pass:
‚úÖ You're ready to deploy to Vercel/Netlify/etc!
