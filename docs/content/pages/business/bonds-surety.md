# The Mark of a Trusted Professional

In business, a promise is only as strong as the guarantee behind it. A surety bond from Texas General Insurance is that guarantee. It's a powerful tool that demonstrates your financial stability and commitment to your contractual obligations, giving your clients and partners the ultimate confidence to do business with you.

## What is a Surety Bond?

A surety bond is a three-party agreement that provides a financial guarantee:

- **The Principal:** You or your business, who is obligated to perform a service.
- **The Obligee:** The client or government entity requiring the bond.
- **The Surety:** The insurance company that guarantees your obligation.

By securing a bond, you are signaling to the world that your work is backed by a reputable financial institution.
