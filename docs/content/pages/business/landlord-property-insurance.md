# Protect Your Property, Your Income, and Your Investment

Whether you manage a single rental home or a large portfolio of commercial and residential properties, your real estate is a valuable asset. Standard insurance isn't designed to cover the unique risks that property investors face. Our specialized Landlord and Property Insurance policies provide the robust protection you need to safeguard your investment from unexpected events.

## Essential Coverage for Every Property Owner

A tailored policy is crucial for protecting your real estate portfolio. Key coverages include:

- **Property Damage Protection:** Covers your buildings and other on-site structures from fire, storms, and other covered perils. It also covers any of your personal property, like appliances, left for tenant use.
- **Liability Coverage:** Protects you from financial loss if a tenant or their guest is injured on your property and you are found legally responsible. This covers medical costs and legal fees.
- **Loss of Rental Income:** If your property becomes uninhabitable due to a covered event, this coverage helps replace the rental income you lose while the unit is being repaired or rebuilt.

## Smart Add-Ons for Complete Peace of Mind

- **Tenant Damage:** Consider optional coverage for intentional damage caused by tenants.
- **Personal Injury Protection:** Protects you from claims of wrongful eviction, wrongful entry, or invasion of privacy.
- **Bundling Discounts:** Combine your landlord policy with other TGI policies to receive a significant discount.
