# Your Business is Your Legacy. We Protect It Like Our Own.

As a business owner, you face unique risks every day. Texas General Insurance provides comprehensive commercial insurance solutions designed to protect your hard work, your employees, and your bottom line. We partner with you to build a shield of protection so you can focus on what you do best: growing your business.

## Core Coverage Every Business Needs

We create a customized insurance program from a wide range of essential coverages:

- **General Liability Insurance:** Your first line of defense against claims of bodily injury, property damage, or personal injury that occur on your premises or as a result of your operations.
- **Commercial Property Insurance:** Protects your physical assets, including your building, equipment, inventory, and furniture, from events like fire, theft, and natural disasters.
- **Workers' Compensation:** Provides medical benefits and wage replacement to employees injured on the job, while protecting you from employee lawsuits, as required by law in most states.
- **Commercial Auto Insurance:** Covers vehicles used for your business, providing liability and physical damage protection that a personal auto policy won't cover.

## Specialized Protection for Your Industry

Beyond the basics, we can tailor your policy with specialized coverage such as:

- **Professional Liability (Errors & Omissions):** Essential for service-based businesses to protect against claims of negligence or failure to perform.
- **Cyber Liability Insurance:** Protects your business from the devastating costs of a data breach or cyberattack.
- **Business Owner's Policy (BOP):** A convenient package that bundles general liability and commercial property insurance at a discounted rate for eligible small businesses.
