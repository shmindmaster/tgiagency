This is used to improve your experience, understand our audience, and contact you when needed. Typically, you provide this information when purchasing services or submitting comments or questions.

(b) **Automatic Information (Cookies):** To provide content users need, we collect aggregated site-visitation statistics using cookies.

We may disclose limited information (name, company, address, phone numbers, email) to third parties. If you do not wish to have such information disclosed, please contact us. When you order products, we use your credit card number and billing address only to bill you for that specific order. Any user questions or comments may become public on the Web Site (e.g., in a "Frequently Asked Questions" section) without personally identifying facts.
