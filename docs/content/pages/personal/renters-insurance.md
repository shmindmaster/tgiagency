# Your Landlord Covers the Walls. We Cover Your World.

If you rent your home, you might think you're covered by your landlord's insurance. But their policy only protects the building—not your personal belongings. For less than the cost of a few coffees a month, renters insurance from TGI protects everything you own.

## What Does Renters Insurance Actually Protect?

It's surprisingly powerful coverage that safeguards your finances in three key ways:

- **Personal Property Protection:** Covers the cost to replace your belongings—laptop, TV, furniture, clothes—if they are stolen, damaged by a fire, or destroyed by a covered event.
- **Personal Liability Coverage:** Protects you if a guest is injured in your apartment or if you accidentally cause damage to a neighbor's property. It covers legal fees and settlement costs.
- **Loss of Use Coverage:** If your rental becomes unlivable due to a covered event like a fire or major water leak, this helps pay for a hotel and other temporary living expenses.

## Why Every Renter Needs It

- **It's incredibly affordable.** Most renters can get comprehensive coverage for just $15-20 per month.
- **It protects more than you think.** Your policy covers your belongings even when they're not in your apartment, like if your laptop is stolen from your car.
- **It gives you liability peace of mind.** An accidental kitchen fire or an overflowing bathtub can lead to thousands in damages. Renters insurance protects you from that financial disaster.
