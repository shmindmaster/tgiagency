## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does my homeowners insurance cover flooding?
No. Standard homeowners and business insurance policies explicitly exclude flood damage. You need a separate flood insurance policy.

### How much does flood insurance cost?
Costs vary based on your property's flood risk, location, building characteristics, and coverage amount. Many policies start around $400-$700 annually for homes in low-risk areas.

### What's the difference between building and contents coverage?
**Building coverage** protects the structure itself and permanently installed systems (HVAC, plumbing, built-in appliances). **Contents coverage** protects your belongings like furniture, clothing, electronics, and inventory.

### Do I need flood insurance if I'm not in a flood zone?
Yes, you should strongly consider it. More than 20% of flood insurance claims come from properties outside high-risk flood zones. Flooding can happen anywhere it rains.

There's typically a 30-day waiting period from the date of purchase before your policy takes effect. Don't wait until a storm is forecasted.
