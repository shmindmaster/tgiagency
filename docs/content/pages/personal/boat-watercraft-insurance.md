# Set Sail with Complete Peace of Mind

From Lake Conroe to the Gulf Coast, your boat is your ticket to freedom and adventure. At TGI, we offer specialized boat and watercraft insurance that lets you enjoy every moment on the water without worrying about the "what-ifs."

## Essential Coverage for Every Captain

Don't rely on a limited homeowners policy. A dedicated watercraft policy provides the protection you truly need:

- **Physical Damage Coverage:** Protects your boat, trailer, and equipment against theft or damage from collisions, storms, and fire, both on and off the water.
- **Liability Coverage:** Covers costs if your watercraft causes injury to others or damage to their property, including other boats and docks.
- **Medical Payments:** Helps pay for medical treatment for you and your passengers if you're injured in a boating accident.
- **On-Water Towing & Assistance:** Provides peace of mind with coverage for emergency towing, fuel delivery, and other assistance if you're stranded.

## Navigating Your Policy Needs

### Is my boat covered year-round?

Yes! We ensure your policy protects your investment during the boating season and while it's in storage during the off-season.

### What discounts can I get?

We offer discounts for completing boater safety courses, having a good driving record, and bundling with your other TGI policies.

### What if I have an accident?

Our local team is here to help you navigate the claims process quickly and efficiently, so you can get back on the water sooner.
