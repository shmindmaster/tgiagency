# The Protection Your Home Deserves

Your home is your sanctuary, your largest investment, and the center of your family's world. We provide comprehensive homeowner's insurance that protects not just the structure, but the life you've built within its walls. As your local Sugar Land agency, we understand the unique needs of Texas homeowners.

## What Does a Comprehensive Home Policy Cover?

A robust policy is your best defense against the unexpected. We tailor your coverage to include:

- **Dwelling Protection:** Covers the cost to repair or rebuild your home's physical structure from damage caused by fire, wind, hail, or other covered events.
- **Personal Property Coverage:** Protects your belongings—furniture, electronics, clothing, and more—from theft or damage, whether they're inside your home or elsewhere.
- **Liability Protection:** Safeguards you and your assets if someone is accidentally injured on your property, covering medical bills and legal fees.
- **Additional Living Expenses (ALE):** If your home becomes uninhabitable due to a covered loss, this helps pay for temporary housing, meals, and other essential costs.

## Understanding Your Home Coverage

### What about floods or earthquakes?

Standard home insurance does not cover flood or earthquake damage. We can help you secure separate, specialized policies to ensure you're fully protected against these risks.

### How much is my home's replacement cost?

This isn't the same as market value. Replacement cost is the price to rebuild your home from scratch today. We'll help you accurately calculate this to ensure you're never underinsured.

### How can bundling save me money?

Combining your home and auto policies with us is one of the easiest ways to get a significant discount on both premiums while simplifying your life.

## Let's Protect Your Foundation.

Your home is too important for a one-size-fits-all policy. Let's build the right coverage together.
