# Business Insurance 101: **GL vs BOP vs Workers' Comp** (Texas)

You don't buy insurance for fun; you buy it so one ugly day doesn't kill your business. Here's the Texas-specific cheat sheet for **what to buy, when, and why**.

---

## 1) Why Business Insurance Isn't Optional

* **GL = table stakes** for customer-facing or premises-exposed businesses.
* **Contracts & landlords** often require GL or BOP certificates.
* **Texas twist:** Workers' comp is **optional for most private employers** (unique among states)—but opting out has consequences. ([Texas Department of Insurance][11])

---

## 2) General Liability (GL)

**What it covers:** Third-party **bodily injury**, **property damage**, **personal/advertising injury** (think slip-and-fall, your ladder shatters a client's window, or a social post triggers a libel claim). ([III][12])

**Who needs it:** Almost everyone with on-site exposure, customer traffic, or product/completed-operations risk.

**Cost drivers:** Industry, location, revenue/payroll, claims history, limits. ([Insurance.com][13])

**Real-world examples:**

* A customer trips over a floor mat (BI).
* An employee knocks over a server rack at a client site (PD).
* You're sued for a comparative ad (advertising injury). ([The Hartford][14])

---

## 3) Business Owners Policy (BOP)

**What it is:** A **bundle** combining **GL + Commercial Property + Business Interruption** (aka business income) for small/mid-sized risks—typically priced more efficiently than buying à la carte. ([III][15])

**Best for:** Retail, offices, restaurants, light service/contracting.
**Not for:** Heavy manufacturing or high-hazard operations (you'll need a CPP or custom program). ([III][15])

**Pro tip:** If you need property coverage (your own build-out, gear, inventory) **and** GL, a BOP is usually the right starting point.

---

## 4) Workers' Compensation (Texas)

**Texas is different:** **Most private employers can opt out** of workers' comp—**but** opting out means losing liability protections; non-subscribers face direct-suit exposure and specific notice/reporting duties. ([Texas Department of Insurance][16])

**What workers' comp covers:** Medical bills, wage replacement, impairment benefits, and employer liability Part B (Employers' Liability). ([Texas Department of Insurance][17])

**Compliance notes:**

* Buy from a **TDI-licensed** carrier for coverage to count under state law. ([Texas Department of Insurance][18])
* Non-subscribers must **file annual notices** (DWC Form-005) and notify employees. ([GovDelivery][19])

| ----------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **GL**            | Standalone liability | BI/PD, advertising injury                          | Any business with customer/third-party exposure                   | Cyber, hired/non-owned auto          |
| **BOP**           | Bundled package      | GL + Property + **Business Interruption**          | Small/mid-sized with premises, inventory, or equipment            | Equipment breakdown, data compromise |
| **Workers' Comp** | Statutory benefits   | Medical, income benefits; **Employers' Liability** | Employers with W-2 staff (optional for most TX private employers) | Return-to-work, safety services      |

(Coverage varies by carrier and endorsement. Always read forms.)

## 6) How to Choose (Fast)

* **Home-based, no customers onsite?** GL at minimum; consider a BOP if you stock inventory/equipment. ([Investopedia][20])
* **Retail/office/restaurant?** Usually BOP (then add cyber/ EPLI). ([III][15])
* **Employees on payroll?** Strongly consider Workers' Comp even though TX doesn't require it—lawsuits are pricier than premiums. ([Texas Department of Insurance][16])

---

## 7) Bundling Strategies

* Place **GL + Property + BI** on a **BOP** where eligible for best value.
* If you run vehicles, bolt on **Commercial Auto**; if you store data, add **Cyber**.
* Use **umbrella** limits to lift GL/Auto/EL beyond $1M when contracts demand it.
