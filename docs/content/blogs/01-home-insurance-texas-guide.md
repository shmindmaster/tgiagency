# The Ultimate Guide to **Home Insurance in Texas** (2025)

Texas is beautiful, booming—and weather-intense. If you live here, you're balancing hail, wind, tropical systems, drought-soil shifts, and sky-high rebuild costs. This guide shows you exactly what to buy (and what to skip), how to dial in the right limits, and where to find real savings without gutting coverage.

> Bottom line: Buy to **replacement cost**, address **wind** the Texas way, and treat **flood** as its own policy. Your future self will thank you.

## Why Home Insurance Matters More in Texas

* **Severe weather volatility:** Hail and wind losses are frequent; coastal wind exposure is unique (TWIA may be required in designated areas). ([TWIA][1])
* **Lenders require coverage** and will scrutinize deductibles and exclusions.
* **Consumer protections:** Texas requires carriers to give you a **Consumer Bill of Rights**—know your rights when shopping and during claims. ([Texas Department of Insurance][2])

---

## Coverage Types—What You're Actually Buying

### HO-3 vs HO-5 (and why it matters)

* **HO-3** (most common): Open-perils on the structure; *named perils* for contents.
* **HO-5**: Open-perils for structure **and** contents, typically with broader personal-property protection; usually costs more. ([Insure.com][3])

### Key Parts of a Texas Home Policy

* **Dwelling (Coverage A):** Rebuild cost of your home (not market value).
* **Other Structures (B), Personal Property (C), Loss of Use (D), Liability (E), Medical Payments (F).**
* **RCV vs ACV:** Replacement Cost Value pays today's price to replace; Actual Cash Value subtracts depreciation (often a nasty surprise). Choose RCV where possible. ([Forbes][4])

## Texas-Specific Considerations (Don't skip these)

### 1) Wind & Hail on the Coast (TWIA)

In 14 first-tier coastal counties (plus parts of Harris County east of Hwy 146), **wind/hail may be excluded** from standard policies. If a private insurer won't cover wind, you'll place wind/hail through **TWIA**, the state's insurer of last resort for designated catastrophe areas. Eligibility requires: (a) a private-market denial, (b) property inside the designated area, and (c) windstorm-code compliance (with limited exceptions). ([TWIA][1])

**Pro tip:** Plan ahead for **higher wind deductibles** and **roof requirements** in TWIA territories; verify WPI-8 compliance before closing a coastal purchase. ([TWIA][1])

### 2) Foundation & Slab Issues

Standard homeowners policies **don't** cover settling/shrinkage from soil movement, but many Texas carriers offer a **Foundation/Water Damage endorsement** (e.g., HO 04 68) for damage **caused by a plumbing leak beneath the slab**—often capped (e.g., 15% of Coverage A). Not a cure-all, but important in clay-soil regions. ([TRUE Property Insurance][5])

### 3) Flood = Separate Policy

**Homeowners insurance excludes flood.** Use **NFIP** or private flood. FEMA notes **~25% of NFIP claims** come from outside high-risk zones, and even an inch of water can cause **~$25,000** in damage. There's usually a **30-day waiting period** before NFIP coverage starts. ([FEMA][6])

---

## How Much Coverage Do You Need?

### Calculate True Rebuild Cost

Use your agent's replacement-cost estimator and current local construction costs—not Zillow. Many Texas insurers expect **80–100%** of replacement cost; underinsure and you'll co-insure the loss. ([Texas Department of Insurance][7])

### Choose the Right Deductibles

* **Wind/hail** can have a separate % deductible—model your worst-case out-of-pocket.
* Consider higher **All-Peril** deductibles only if you can fund them in cash.

### Set Personal Property to RCV

Upgrade contents to **RCV** so you're not stuck with depreciated payouts on everything you own. ([Forbes][4])

---

## Ways to **Save** (Without Shooting Yourself in the Foot)

* **Bundle home + auto** (often **~15%** average savings; varies by carrier/market). Validate vs. standalone quotes annually. ([Insure.com][8])
* **Protective discounts:** Monitored alarms, water leak sensors, quality roofing.
* **Raise deductibles thoughtfully:** Make sure emergency cash covers the gap.
* **Claims discipline:** Small claims can increase premiums; reserve insurance for material losses.

---

## Common Exclusions & Gotchas

* **Flood & earth movement** (buy separate flood; quake rarely purchased in TX). ([FEMA][9])
* **Wear & tear / maintenance issues.**
* **High-value items** (jewelry, guns, collectibles) need **scheduling** beyond sub-limits.
* **Named-storm/wind deductibles** on the coast—read your dec page.

## How to File a Claim in Texas (Step-by-Step)

1. **Document everything:** Photos/video and a room-by-room list.
2. **Mitigate further damage** (keep receipts).
3. **Contact your carrier/agent ASAP.**
4. **Meet the adjuster;** keep your own contractor estimate for leverage.
5. **Track deadlines** and your **Bill of Rights**; escalate to TDI if needed. ([Texas Department of Insurance][10])

## FAQs

**Is wind covered near the coast?**
Often **no**—you may need TWIA for wind/hail in designated counties or parts of Harris County. ([TWIA][1])

**Do I really need flood if I'm not in a "flood zone"?**
**Yes, strongly recommended.** About a quarter of NFIP claims come from outside high-risk zones; one inch of water can cost ~$25k. ([FEMA][6])

**What about foundation coverage?**
Consider the **HO 04 68** endorsement for slab/plumbing-leak scenarios; read limits and exclusions. ([TRUE Property Insurance][5])
