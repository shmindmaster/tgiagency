# How to **Bundle Home + Auto** and Actually Save

Bundling is not a personality trait. It's a spreadsheet. Here's how to run it like a CFO—and when to **not** bundle.

---

## What Is Insurance Bundling?

Buying **home** and **auto** (and sometimes umbrella, boat, etc.) from one carrier to get a **multi-policy discount** and simpler billing.

---

## Average Savings: What to Expect in 2025

* National analyses show **~15% average** savings on home+auto bundles (around **$700/yr**, but highly variable). Some carriers advertise up to the **20–25%** range. ([Insure.com][8])
* Market caveat: With auto rates rising, bundling isn't **always** the cheapest path; compare both ways yearly. ([Insurance.com][27])

---

## Benefits Beyond Savings

* **Simplified claims and billing** (one carrier, fewer portals).
* **Potential combined deductibles** (for the same event) with some insurers. ([NAIC][28])
* **Eligibility for umbrella** and preferred tiers.

---

## When Bundling Makes Sense

* Your carrier is competitive on **both** lines for your risk profile.
* You need **umbrella** and want single-carrier coordination.
* You value one renewal date/one point of contact enough to justify a small price delta.

## When It Might Not

* **Unique risks** (e.g., coastal wind exclusions, classic auto) push you to specialty markets.
* The **bundle discount** is outweighed by a superior standalone quote.

---

## How to Compare (Do the Math)

1. Get a **bundled quote** (home + auto + umbrella).
2. Get **standalone quotes** for home and auto separately (include any coastal/TWIA wind and flood if applicable).
3. Build a **TCO** view: annual premium ± discounts **and** your deductibles/out-of-pocket in a claim.
4. Confirm **apples-to-apples limits** (RCV on contents, glass, rental, UM/UIM, etc.).
5. Re-shop at renewal or after major life changes.

---

## Other Policies to Consider for Multi-Policy Discounts

* **Umbrella**, **boat/RV/motorcycle**, **landlord** unit, and sometimes **life**.

---

## Quick Q&A

**How big are typical bundle discounts?**
Around **~15%** average on home+auto, with variability by company and state. ([Insure.com][8])

**Is bundling always cheaper?**
No. Recent rate dynamics mean sometimes splitting carriers wins. **Compare annually.** ([Insurance.com][27])
