# Your Neighbors in Protection

Texas General Insurance wasn't founded in a boardroom. It was built right here in Sugar Land, with a simple mission: to treat our clients like neighbors and provide the kind of honest, personal insurance advice you can't get from a 1-800 number.

For years, we've watched our community grow, and we've grown with it. We understand the unique challenges and opportunities of living and working in Texas because we're doing it, too. We're not just agents; we're parents, homeowners, and local business supporters.

Our independence is your advantage. As an independent agency, we don't work for one giant corporation. We work for you. This allows us to compare policies from a wide range of top-rated carriers to find the perfect blend of coverage and value for your specific needs.

At TGI, we're building more than a book of businessâ€”we're building relationships. We're here to be your trusted advisor for life's biggest moments, offering clarity and confidence every step of the way.
