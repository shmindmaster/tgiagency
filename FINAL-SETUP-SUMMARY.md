## ‚ö†Ô∏è Final Steps (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Get Service Role Key (1 min)
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/oohttpknzjchpdfogled/settings/api
2. Find "service_role" key (marked "secret")
3. Click reveal/copy

### Step 2: Add Remaining GitHub Secrets (2 min)

**Option A: Manual**
- Go to: https://github.com/shmindmaster/tgiagency/settings/secrets/actions
- Add these 4 secrets:

```
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = [REDACTED:jwt-token]
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY = [from Supabase dashboard]
CLARITY_API_KEY = [REDACTED:jwt-token]
SENDGRID_API_KEY = [REDACTED:sendgrid-api-token]
```

**Option B: Automated (paste service key, I'll run commands)**
Just paste the service role key here and I'll execute the GitHub CLI commands.

### Step 3: Verify SendGrid Sender (1 min)
1. Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth/senders
2. Add sender: noreply@tgiagency.com
3. Click verification email link
4. **Critical:** Without this, emails won't send!

### Step 4: Test Everything (1 min)
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
# Test quote + contact forms
```

## üéØ What Works Right Now

### Without Service Role Key:
- ‚úÖ Website builds and runs
- ‚úÖ Clarity analytics configured
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Forms work but use anon key (less secure for API routes)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è GitHub Actions will fail

### With Service Role Key:
- ‚úÖ Everything above
- ‚úÖ API routes use proper server credentials
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions pass
- ‚úÖ Production-ready security
- ‚úÖ Email notifications work

Once secrets are added, you can deploy to:

# Deploy
vercel

# Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
# Or import from .env.local:
vercel env pull
```

**Other Platforms:**

All require the same environment variables from `.env.local`
